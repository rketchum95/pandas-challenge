### Analysis

* No discernable differences in scores based on overall grade levels

* Math has the highest failure rate with only 75% students passing the subject.  This is a major contributing factor of the low overall passing percentage of 65%.

* Between District schhols and Charter schools, Charters have the highest passing rate at 90.56%, with the district's 53.7%.  Charter schools outranked all district schools  with overall passing rates taking all top 8 positions.
  *   Size of the school itself is misleading as Charter schools have a smaller student body therefore needs less square footage.
  * I think there needs to be additional information to determine why district schools performed poorly compared to the charter schools.  Some questions I have regarding the data:  
    *   Are these grades based on standard tests? 
    *   Did class affect the learning? 
    *   Different curriculum?  
    *   Better calibur of teachers?
